## Objective

Our objective was to create a webpage where college students and other people with low time/resources could figure out what to cook with only the given ingredients they have in their fridge. Our main goal was to make cooking easier and a better experience for users.

## Plan

We decided to tackle the project in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Edamam's Recipe Search API, as well as Firebase for authentication. The styling was made to look modern and sleek, in order to appeal to our target audiences.
